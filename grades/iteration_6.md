# Iteration 6 Evaluation - Group 2 Footsie

### Presentation
(Was the presentation itself done well - was it well-organized, easy to understand, and convincing?)

Great job.

#### App demo
(Did app work well?  Did any errors arise during the demo?  How did the demo'd implementation line up with features proposed?)

Nice new tag feature!

Generally it looks like very thorough implementation.  E.g. spell checking on tags, menu states updated properly, etc.  You did a great job of getting corner cases nailed.

#### UI quality based on the demo
(Was it well-designed? Was it usable?  Did it have glitches?)

Generally it was solid iOS stuff.

### Testing and Coverage
(Continue to write more tests for new features and keep high coverage?)
 
Coverage is pretty good!

### Build and Deployment and git usage
(Same as previous iterations)

Great job!

### Non-CRUD feature
(How did it turn out?)

Overall it looks pretty good.

### Iteration progress reporting
(Final CHANGELOG.md and project boards updated?)

Reporting is really detailed, great!

### Evaluation of project difficulty
(in terms of lines of code, conceptual difficulty, non-CRUD features, degree of completion)

### Overall Remarks

You guys aced it.  Very nice modular code on e.g. combiner etc

**Grade: 97/100**
