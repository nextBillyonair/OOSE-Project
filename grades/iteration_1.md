## Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 2

**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### The project idea 
(Too easy or too difficult? A coherent application?)

Using mesh networks to create a social networking app and other usecases like using the mesh to make paid announcements are all great ideas. You do need to prototype as soon as possible to know the feasibility of the project. Some things that you need to checkout in your prototype are:

* Does the library you're using work in both send and receive mode?
* Can React native interact with lower level API's?

### Features
(Do features align with vision, UI sketches, and use-cases? Are there non-CRUD features?)

Features align with the vision and it seems like you have a plan in mind and seems like you'll be able to complete all your suggested features within the timeline suggested but you definitely need to prototype asap to figure out if everything you've suggested is possible or not.


### UI sketches
(Complete with respect to features? Realistic visions of the app that have "real fake" data in them?)

The sketches meet the requirements but a more polished version of these would definitely help. The ones that are submitted in the app don't seem like realistic visions of the app. You should use something like proto to simulate iOS UiKit elements.

(-2 Points)

### Use Cases
(Are all important multi-step actions not clear from the UI sketches presented in use-cases?)

Most of the multi-step actions clear from the UI sketches but it could have been made a bit more intuitive.

### Architecture
(Are the choices realistic? Is serious prototyping work needed to ensure the app is feasible?)

As pointed earlier, you need to prototype as soon as possible to figure out if you'll be able to implement what you've proposed. This needs to be done by iteration 2.

### General Remarks

The idea is really good and it's actually a challenging project that'll help you learn a lot.
