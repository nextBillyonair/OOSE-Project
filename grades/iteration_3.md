# Iteration 3 Evaluation - Group 2

**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
(Dev stack all stood up, and a few core features working?  Basic demo running?  Some progress on non-CRUD features?)

Seems like you have worked out details for your new idea but I haven't seen a demo yet. I need to see a working chat by the next iteration.

### Design check-in
(Is the project on-track in terms of the evolved design?  It is still a good amount of work given how it has evolved?  Are there flaws emerging in the design, or features that should be added or removed?)

I still see that your project is running behind but I'm willing to cut you some slack till the next iteration. I really want the basic chat working by the next iteration. Although the new sketches look much better.

### Code Quality
(Good file structure?  Good use of object-oriented design principles thus far in the codebase?  Correct use of frameworks?  Are there other frameworks or tools you should be using that you are not now?)
 
So far the code looks good but since most of it is boilerplate, can't really judge that much.

### Git usage
(Group members are all being good about regular commits, use of branches, pull requests, etc?  All members contributing well?)

Git usage, in general, is good but one of your teammates has contributed significantly less than the others. I would really like to see more commits from Riley.

#### Use of the GitHub issue tracker to manage bugs, features, etc.

All good here but I'd suggest using labels to mark features, bugs, iteration numbers etc. 

#### Codebase pushed to master on your team's GitHub repository for our inspection

Looks good!

### Iteration submission and reporting

Looks good!

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
(Could we successfully build the project from the README alone?)

This is where you need a lot of work. First of all, I couldn't find any build instructions in README. I agree that you have pointed us to read the setup script but there's nothing to read there. It's simply a setup script. You needed to put up build instructions of some kind. Also, there's no mention of FB SDK in the setup script. How does your setup script include that?

#### Top-level file CHANGELOG.md present in your repo and describes progress in this iteration well

All good here!

#### Use of GitHub's project boards to keep track of your progress
(You need to have a column for each iteration and to have sketched out what future iteration you are going to implement the various features.  You need to have very clear goals for the next iteration (4).  Also, any features not implemented in iteration 3 need to be moved to iteration 4.  You need to have at least some features penciled in for iterations 5 and 6.)

Looks good!

### Other Remarks

You guys need to have a basic demo working like yesterday.
