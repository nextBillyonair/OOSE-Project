# Iteration 2 Evaluation - Group 2

**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### Features
As talked with you, your features don't reflect what you have proposed in your architecture. You guys need to prototype fast!

### UI sketches
(Improved as either needed or required based on iteration 1 feedback?)

Even though I suggested you to improve your UI sketches, you haven't sone so yet. Use tools like proto to make close to real sketches! Right now they don't seem real enough and we want to see sketches that you'll actually be coming up with in your app using React or UiKit. So, please update this as soon as possible.

### Endpoint and/or other interface documentation
(Complete relative to UI sketches, UML, etc?  JSON in/out shown?  Error code cases shown?)

Since you haven't shown any kind of server in your stack and thus no API endpoints or even if you were not planning on a server, there are no JSON in/out in case of communication between 2 nearby devices on bluetooth.

### UML Class diagram
(Good coverage of design?  Proper use of whole-part diamonds, associations, multiplicities, etc?  Actions in app mapped to methods?)

UML class diagram looks good. Good job on that!

### Architecture
(Revisions if any are good/appropriate?  Described well and pictured if it is not standard?)

Architecture doesn't have any server component, so, some of your features like chat over a greater disctance don't seem possible.

### Initial code
(Challenging libraries prototyped?  Server stood up and some basic code written?  Frontend prototyped? 100+ lines of original code, not just pasting in a 
tutorial?)

Everything seems good here. You just need to show us the prototype for communication between devices by the next lab

#### Initial commit made
(did every group member commit at least once to the repo as was required in the assignment?)

Everyone made commits!

### Other General Remarks

After our discussion on Monday, I feel a bit more confident that you guys will be able to show us a working prototype by the next lab.

**Grade: 91/100**
