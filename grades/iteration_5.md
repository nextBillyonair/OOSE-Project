**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
[25 points] (Core app working including non-CRUD integration?  Features filling out?  UI starting to look good even though it still may have some glitches?)

All good here!

#### Code Quality
[30 points] (Good use of object-oriented design principles in codebase?  Absence of smells in code?)

All good here!

### Testing and Coverage

Testing needs to be improved. You just have 13 tests. No substantial improvement from the last iteration.

**Edit**

You infact had a lot of tests which I missed, so reverting points here.

[5 points] (Same as previous iteration)

All good here!
