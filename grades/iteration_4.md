# Iteration 4 Evaluation - Group 2

**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
[25 points] (More features working?  Improved demo running?  Good progress on non-CRUD including some integration? Project is looking to have appropriate degree of difficulty overall?)

I'm impressed with the progress you guys have made over the last few weeks but you still have to work on most of your non-CRUD features. 

(-3 points)

#### Code Quality
[10 points] (Good file structure?  Good use of object-oriented design principles thus far in codebase?  Correct use of frameworks?  Are there other frameworks or tools you should be using that you are not now?)

I Feel you can improve your file structure. Right now everything is in the root directory. You should have a directory for documentation, backend and another one for the frontend. Apart from that everything else looks great!

(-3 Points)

**Edit**

(-1.5 points)


### Testing
[20 points] (A fully functioning test harness using good code methodology in terms of test setup and tear-down?)

Everything looks great here! 

#### Test coverage
[10 points] Good coverage with tests?

All good!

#### Travis
[5 points] (Travis-CI integration tests working?  Tests are at integration level?)

Travis-CI is working fine but you should consider adding a Travis batch to your README.

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
[5 points]

All looks good here!


### Deployment
[5 points] (Server deployed on Heroku or AWS or other?)

Looks good. Do add the deployment link to the README as well.

### Advanced Git usage
[10 points] (Still being good about regular commits, pull requests, etc?  Additionally, development primarily taking place on feature branches, no personal-named branches, good git workflow overall?)

All good here! 

### Iteration submission and reporting

You need to make a better iteration submission though. Please add the things explicitly required for that iteration. Your submission doesn't have a lot of the things that should have been there.

#### CHANGELOG.md updated and project boards updated, filling in goals for iterations 5 and 6
[10 points]

All good here!


### Other Remarks

Overall it looks like you're on track but you should now focus on the non-CRUD features, UI 


**Grade: 95.5/100**
